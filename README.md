# rustlings solutions 🦀❤️

Hi! In the interest of learning rust I decided to fork `rustlings`. This repo contains my solutions 😊.

To setup the repo on your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/quinnwerks/rustlings
cd rustlings
git checkout tags/4.3.0 # or whatever the latest version is (find out at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/releases/latest)
cargo install --force --path .
```
To verify the solutions on your machine:
```
rustlings verify
```
